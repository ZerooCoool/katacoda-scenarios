# Introduction

# Gradle for Automated testing & build
In software development testing of code is an integral part of the process which ensures the quality of the software. Automating this process by running integrated tests and builds whenever new contributions are added to the code will help in identifying errors & bugs and fixing them early on. It also makes the development process a lot more efficient. Gradle is a tool which automates the build process and is compatable with almost any type of software.

# GitHub actions for CI/CD pipeline
Automated testing & build goes hand in hand with CI/CD pipelines. When new code is added it is sent through the CI pipeline and the new code is automatically compiled and tested. If everything is okay the code is automatically merged to the main project and a new version of the software is deployed through the CD pipeline. GitHub actions is a CI/CD platform which lets you do just this. Since it is integrated with GitHub it is a very powerful yet simple way to create an automated build enviroment for your DevOps.
