# What is the Difference between Unit and Integration testing?
In step 5 of the tutorial you will learn how to add both unit and integration tests to your project. Unit testing involves testing certain pieces of the code while integration testing involves testing multiple different units, modules or components of the software application. So integration tests are more extensive where modules are tested as a group to see that data communication works correctly. Unit tests on the other hand are typically automated and verifies that an individual unit of the code works as intended.

# Why are both neccessary?
In software development both unit and integration tests are neccessary. Unit testing is used to make sure that one unit of the code works, these tests are also easier to carry out so they are run more frequently. Integration testing tests modules of code to see how they perform and interact with other parts of the software. If there is a problem in one unit of the code the unit test will discover this whilst if there is a problem with a module or interaction between modules or dependencies the integration tests will discover this. Hence, unit and integration tests complement eachother since they can discover weaknesses in the code that the other test missed. Therefore we need both in a sucessfull DevOps.
