## Repeat changes:

* Step 6: Added more explaining text for the scripts provided.
* Step 7: Added more explainations, also clearified that we will not add the script and data to publish our Gradle artifact to a Maven repository, but explain how you could add this to the build file to show that Gradle can be used with other tools.
